              <summary>Introducing a status page can be a pretty big change for some organizations. It's important to set expectations with your team, and communicate with your users so they know your statuspage exists.</summary>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <h3>1. Define your Audience</h3>
                <p>Make sure you know how you intend to use StatusPage. Is this for internal or external communication? Should everyone receive the same updates or do certain issues only affect certain end users.</p>
                <h3>2. Rally the Troops</h3>
                <p>Define which team(s) and roles own the StatusPage. This is crucial for initial implementation and longevity. Better to sort this out Day 1, before the first live incident.</p>
