              <p><b>Rally The Troops:</b> Define which team(s) and roles own the StatusPage. This is crucial for initial implementation and longevity. Better to sort this out Day 1, before the first live incident.</p>
              <p><b>Adopt A Culture of Transparency:</b> Gone are the days when downtime was something you kept hush hush. Customers expect a certain level of transparency these days. Read up on the Service Recovery Paradox.</p>
